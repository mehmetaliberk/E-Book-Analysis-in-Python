The aim of this project was to develop a console application using the python
programming language. In this project, we were assigned to extract data from the
internet and perform operations on that data. More descriptively my code will take 2
different books from user and compare their word frequencies depending on the
numbers and display each books word frequencies separately, both books common and
distinct words to the user.
